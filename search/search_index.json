For example, R&D Department manages one Azure subscription, Mobile App Development Team manages AWS account. Coster allows you to configure allocation using a number of logical containers inside the clouds or across the clouds, for example, to combine an arbitrary set of logical units inside one cloud or pick and choose from different clouds. Upon creation of a budget you can add budget type to set business context: business unit, project and team. Important features of budgets Budget amount is set for one month. Each 1st day of the month cost calculation starts from 0. Budget scope can only include clouds with the same currency. E.g. if Azure bills are in rupees and AWS in dollars, such clouds should be in separate budgets . To check currency of your cloud go to section Manage cloud connection . One resource and its cost can be attributed only to one budget. All budgets are created in currency of the tenant. To check tenant currency open Create budget , currency symblol is over the amout field. User cannot change tenant currency. How to use Name the budget to relate it to a business unit. Choose a relevant budget type. This will help to sort the budgets and understand how they correspond to organization structure. Set one of the Coster users to be budget owner. Set budget amount for calendar month (from 1st till last day of the month). Amount will reset in the beginning of each month. Set budget as parent or child. Budgets can be only one level deep. Sum of the child budgets' amounts should not exceed amount of parent budget. Set budget expiration period, period for which monthly budget amount is active. Choose actions to be performed with the budget after expiration date: to delete or to extend. Coster will send a reminder of the event to the budget owner 7 days prior the expiration date. Set scope of objects that will contribute to budget costs. Save the budget. Important One resource and its cost can be attributed only to one budget. If you do not see one of the items in the cloud tree, it is possible that it is included to other budget. Budget settings Budget name User can create and change name of the budget to fit business needs. Budget name should be unique. Budget amount is amount that you plan to spend this month for the cloud objects in scope. Coster sends email notifications when spend reaches 90% and 100% of budget amount. Values that exceed the budget limit are highlighted in yellow and red in columns Progress and Forecast. Owner Coster user who will receive notifications in case spend exceeds 90% and 100% of the budget limit. Budget scope cost generating cloud objects that can be attributed to budgets by one of the parameters (exclusively): by object grouping or by tags. In the first case, scope is based on the selection of the logical containers in the clouds by which costs will be summed (e.g. accounts, resource groups), in the second case \u2014 on tag keys and values by which objects' costs will be filtered and summed. Important Tags are now available only in Azure and AWS. Consumption details Budget amount is set in currency of the organization's tenant and will be recalculated in tables to user currency if it differs, Spend shows current month total costs, Progress shows amount spent in this budget, Forecast shows amount forecasted to be spent by the end of month. Hover over the amounts to see percentage ratio to budget amount. Actions with budgets By clicking on the budget, opens Detailed view pane.
